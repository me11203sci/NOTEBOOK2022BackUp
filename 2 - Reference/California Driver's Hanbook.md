#### Section 8 - An Introduction to Driving
- To determine if one is able to drive, one must consider any impediments to one's hearing or vision:
	- Earbuds, headphones, earplugs, etc.
	- Fatigue and drowsiness.
	- Medication both prescription and over the counter.
	- Any medical condition that may hamper one's hearing or vision such as lapses of consciousness, Alzheimer's disease, etc. 
- It is important to maintain vehicle before driving by:  
	- Cleaning windows and mirrors.
	- Adjusting seat and mirrors.
	- Checking tires. 
- There are 3 ways to handle the steering wheel in order to control the vehicle:
	- When using the Hand-to-hand method your hands do not cross the face of the steering wheel. Considered the safest method.
	- Hand-over-hand should be used to turn at low speeds, park, or when recovering from a skid.
	- One-handed steering should only be use either when turning while backing up or when operating vehicle controls.
-  Signals are important for communicating your intentions to other drivers. In a car one can signal using either your signal lights or hand-and-arm positions as follows:
	- **Left:** Arm straight out.
	- **Right:** Arm bent (at the elbow) upwards.
	- **Slow or Stop:** Arm bent (at the elbow) downwards.
- You should signal: 
	- 100 feet before turning, before every lane change.
	- At least five seconds before you change lanes on a freeway.
	- Please just remember to use your turn signals when you intend to turn.
