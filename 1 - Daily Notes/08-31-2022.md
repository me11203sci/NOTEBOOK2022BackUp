### Notes:
- 1575 Data Structures and Algorithms:
	- Pointer to Classes:
		```cpp
		class Student
		{
			int age;
		};
		
		Student *p;
		p = new Student;
		```
		- Dereferencing:
			- `->` or `*`
				- `*` instructs the compiler to jump to the address stored in the variable. 
		```cpp
		*p.age = 27; // Error, as p is just a pointer
		(*p).age = 27; // This runs as it forces the derefferencing of the pointer first.
		p -> age = 27;
		```
		```cpp
		class Student
		{
			int age;
			void setAge(int x)
			{
				age = x;
			}
		};
		
		Student* p;
		p = new Student;
		p -> setAge(43);
		```
	- `this`:
		- Points to calling object.
	- Classes with Pointers:
		```cpp
		class Frog
		{
			int* p;
			Frog(int x)
			{
				p = new int;
				*p = x;
			}
		};
		Frog JasonFunderburker(5);
		```
		- The Shallow Copy:
			- Copies member pointers such that both the original and copy point to the same spot in memory. This means that changes to the values of the original will affect the copy.
- 1300 American History:
	- Virginia was only successful after the discovery of tobacco.
	- Death from malaria and other diseases run rampant.
	- 1624 the King appoints a royal governor and a council that can veto the House of Burgesses.
	- King establishes Anglican Church of which membership was mandatory and members had to pay taxes.
	- Criticisms of government would result in public humiliation.
	- 1632 Maryland
		- Proprietor is in charge of land. 
		- Religious toleration.
		- Sugar farms in the British West Indies are up to 4 times as profitable as tobacco colonies.
		- African slaves quickly replaced indentured servants leading to the Slave Code of 1661.
		- Navigation Act protects the interests of the nobility.
		- Royal African Company was established in 1672.
- 2210 Digital Logic:
	- When preforming 2's complement calculations:
		- If overflow occurs discard bit.
	- Logical Operations and Boolean Expressions:
		- NOT (A bar)

			| A   | A bar |
			| --- | ----- |
			| 0   | 1     |
			| 1   | 0     |
		
		- AND (AcapB)

			| A   | B   | AB |
			| --- | --- | ----- |
			| 0   | 0   | 0     |
			| 0   | 1   | 0     |
			| 1   | 0   | 0     |
			| 1   | 1   | 0     | 

		- OR ()

			| A   | B   | AcupB |
			| --- | --- | ----- |
			| 0   | 0   | 0     |
			| 0   | 1   | 1     |
			| 1   | 0   | 1     |
			| 1   | 1   | 1     | 

		- NOR (bar A+B)
		
			| A   | B   | bar A+B |
			| --- | --- | --------- |
			| 0   | 0   | 1         | 
			| 0   | 1   | 0         |
			| 1   | 0   | 0         |
			| 1   | 1   | 0         |

		- NAND (bar AB)

			| A   | B   | bar AB |
			| --- | --- | ------ |
			| 0   | 0   | 0      |
			| 0   | 1   | 0      |
			| 1   | 0   | 0      |
			| 1   | 1   | 1      |
- Engineering Statistics:
	- Conditional Probability:
		- Two events may be related and in order to calculate the probability of an event of interest A, then we must use information about related event B.
			> P(A|B)=P(AcapB)/P(B)
			- The above means "the probability of A given B"
		- Independence: A and B are independent if whether A does or does not occur does not affect the outcome of B.
			- Use definition of mutually exclusive.
			- Def
	- Rules of Probability:
		- Complement Rule: P(A')=1-P(A)
		- Multiplication Rule: P(AcapB)=P(A|B) * P(B) 
		- Addition Rule: P(AcupB) = P(A)+P(B)-P(AcapB)
		- A_1, A_2, A_3 must be mutually exclusive and exhastive
		- Law of Total Probability:  $P(B)=P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) + P(B|A_3)P(A_3)$
		- Bayes Rule: $P(A_1|B)={(P(B|A_1)P(A_1))\over (P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) + P(B|A_3)P(A_3))}$
