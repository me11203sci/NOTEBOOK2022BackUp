### Notes:
- Physics:
	- Kinematics in 2D:
		- Position Vector: $r=r_x\hat i+r_y\hat j=x\hat i+y\hat j$
		- Average Velocity: $\vec v_{avg}={\Delta \vec r\over \Delta t}$
		- Instantaneous Velocity: $\vec v = {d\vec r\over dt}={dx\over dt}\hat i+{dy\over dt}\hat j$ 
		- Acceleration: $\vec a = {d\vec v\over dt}={d^2x\over dt^2}\hat i+{d^2y\over dt^2}\hat j$
			- If the acceleration vector is parallel to velocity, then speed changes.
			- If acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, then the direction changes.
			- In 2D, the x and y components of acceleration decouple and therefore a set of 2 equations similar to those used in 1D.
