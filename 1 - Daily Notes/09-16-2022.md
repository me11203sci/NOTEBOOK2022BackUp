- Digital Logic:
	- Lecture 11:
		- Complete Logic Sets: NAND, NOR, A.O.I. (And, Or, Inverter)
- Engineering Statistics:
	- Lecture 7: Continuous Distribution
		- Name of the game: Integrals.
		- Recall, a random variable X is continuous if it can be have any real number value.
		- Knowing the domain of X is important.
		- If X is continuous then P(X=a) is always 0.
		- the pmf analog is pdf (density).
			- pmf satisfies: 
				1. 0<=f(x)<=1, for all x
				2. sum of f(x)=1
			- Similarly, pdf satisfies:
				1. f(x)>=0
				2. $\int_a^b$f(d)dx=1, where a is the lower bound and b is the upper bound of the domain of X.
			- Cumulative distribution function:
				- Distinguished by the uppercase F(x).
					$F(x)=P(X<=x)=\int_{-\infinity}^xf(u)du$ for -infin < x< infin
					Specific values a and b: P(a<x<b)=$\int_a^bf(x)dx$
				- NOTE: Here the area under the curve is the probability.
				- Thus, P(X=a)=0 because P(a<X<a)=$\int_a^af(d)dx=0$
